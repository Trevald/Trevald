- 👋 Hi, I’m @Trevald
- 👀 I’m interested in UX/UI, Graphic Design, HMTL, CSS, SVG, JavaScript, A11y, Vue, MarkDown
- 🌱 I’m currently working as an UX-designer for an insurance company designing some of their internal tools. On my spare time I try put some love into my side projects:
  - [http://forzatime.com](ForzaTime.com) - Like Tinder for soccer fixtures. ATM only touch support due to swiping.
  - [https://fardig.io](Fardig.io) - MD based Texteditor that has a command palette, collects all your todos in one view and uses Dropbox for auth and storage. Own your own data! 
  - [http://dizzision.com](Dizzision.com) - Wheel of fortune in carnival style
  - [https://trevald.github.io/figout/](Figout) - Simple CSS helper to work with flexbox in a more user friendly way. Inspired by Figmas auto layout.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any of my side projects. Especially fardig.io which I think has huge potential but requires more work than I can put into it.
- 📫 Reach me on Twitter, @trevald.
